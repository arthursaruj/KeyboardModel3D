![Preview](docs/preview_hero.png)

## What’s inside
- `models/keyboard_65.blend` — source (real scale, meters)
- `exports/keyboard_65.glb` — recommended
- `exports/keyboard_65.fbx`, `exports/keyboard_65.obj` — compatibility

## Naming
- One object per keycap. Names like: `K_A`, `K_1!`, `K_2@`, `K_[{`, `K_]}', `K_\|`, `K_/?`, `K_ESCAPE`, `K_LSHIFT`, `K_SPACEBAR`, etc.

## Use in Unity
1. Drag `exports/keyboard_65.glb` into **Assets**.
2. Each cap’s pivot is at the stem → press animation ready.
3. (Optional) Use a key animator script to move caps on input.
